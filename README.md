## CUGO

This repository contains the scripts for colocalized unidirectional gene organization (CUGO) analyses, based on the GlobDB (https://globdb.org/). 

The scripts and notebook are functional in the conda environment described in the yml file, but generally this python implementation isn't designed to be broadly useable yet.
